## Versions

### My TicTacToe Game consists of two versions.

- TicTacToeV1.rb is my first version of my game. It has so many repeated code. So I play with the code regularly and changed it.
- TicTacToe.rb is refactored version of my game. I refactored and reviewed it a few times.In each refactoring I changed something such as, win condition,`move` method,`print_board method`, repeated code taken inside the methods. Methods are much concise.

#### Both version is avaible to play but TicTacToe.rb codes are much more readable and neat.
